# Experience

## Data Scientist at CERN / ETH 
Feb 2018 - Present

• Lead research scientist in the study to statistically reject the null hypothesis at a very high significance level of 0.00006 to confirm CERN, CMS’s 1st ever independent Higgs boson observation. Implemented an end-to-end data science pipeline (incl. decision trees and neural network classifiers) for large data (~TB) on the HPC cluster. 

• Deployed state-of-the-art transformer-based Graph Neural Network model to reduce simulation statistical error in our scientific analysis by up to ~60%. 

• Developed Quantile Regression Algorithm to regress quantiles of data using simulation input leading to reduction of simulation systematic error in several associated scientific measurements.

# Projects

## Explainable Breast tumor classification & semantic segmentationExplainable Breast tumor classification & semantic segmentation 
Computer Vision

► Transfer learning and fine-tuning CNN models like VGG19, ResNet, and EfficientNet as well as transformer models like Vision Transformer to achieve an average recall of 0.81 for classification.
► Implemented UNet and its variation with attention and residual connections to achieve IoU of 0.72.
► Deployed final web application with GradCAM insights for both segmentation and classification.
